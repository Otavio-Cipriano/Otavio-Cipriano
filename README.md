## About me:

My name is Otávio Cipriano, I currently live in São Paulo, Brasil and I am a web developer or I consider myself one.

I started studying programming in 2018 with C# and I was aiming to make games, but not to work for a big company that made a game I like, but to make games for myself and for people who might like the same things I do.

Nowadays, I have started to enjoy programming more, especially web development and am focusing on learning more and working as a web developer.
